Dear visitor,

This is my new personal website and blog.

Here you will find information [about me](https://cnogola.github.io/about/ "Gonçalo Lourenço | About") and my working experience as a software tester.

If you are looking for someone to work with, go ahead, download my [cv](https://cnogola.github.io/cv/ "Gonçalo Lourenço | CV") and drop me a line.

If you end up here by accident and you are interested in software testing, biking or maps, well, lucky you! Why not just read one of my [blog](https://cnogola.github.io/blog "Gonçalo Lourenço | Blog") entries on those subjects.

_Cheers_
Gonçalo
