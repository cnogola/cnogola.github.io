### Me

My name is Gonçalo Lourenço, I'm 36 years old and a proudly father of two. In my spare time i like to read, listen music and exercise myself, both mentally and physically.

5 years ago i've never imagined that would make a career in software testing. I know more now about sw testing than i knew back than, that's for sure - but the more i learn about this demanding and challenging task the more i realize that there is still much more to learn.

In this 5y of learning i had the opportunity to work with a lot of different people and technologies, using different testing approaches and methodologies but what i found was that there's no such thing as the best way of doing things, it's all too context dependent - and so our practices should be.

Please contact me outside business hours if you think our conversation can take long.
